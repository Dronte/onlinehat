## What is it? 

This repo contains all backend & frontend code for online hat (explain word to your partner) game. This code is originally hosted on https://onlinehat.xyz/

### Why is it here?

Because I've no reason to keep it closed.

### Disclamers

I'm not professional web developer. This is the largest React project I've ever made. When using it for educational purposes, don't consider it as best-practice code.

Backend has no database. All games are stored in memory of the main process.
